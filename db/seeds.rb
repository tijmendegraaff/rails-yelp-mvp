# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# 10.times do
#      Restaurant.create(
#         name: Faker::Book.title
#         address: Address.street_address
#         phone_number: Faker::phone_number
#         category:
#       )
# end

# 20.times do
#      Review.create(
#         content: Faker::Book.title
#         rating: Address.street_address
#       )
# end
